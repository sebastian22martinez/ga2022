# Homework 5: Final Project RFC

Due: November 17th 2022 *in* *class*

Over the next several weeks we will be working on our final projects. A final
extends our game engine in a new way. We all get to choose our own final
project.

But before we start, we need an approved final project proposal. We call this
document an RFC, or Request For Comment. Homework 5 is to create an RFC for
your desired final project. The RFC should include the following information:

+ A title
+ Your name and email address
+ A summary of the current state in that area of the engine
+ A high-level description of proposed changes/additions
+ If you have considered multiple approaches, discuss pros/cons
+ A detailed breakdown of the tasks involved
+ A description of any challenges you expect to encounter

## An Incomplete List of Final Project Ideas

The following is a list of some potential final projects. Feel free to propose
something not on this list!

+ Render/gpu improvements: load and render textured models, add lighting, etc.
+ Input improvements: support a range of different input devices.
+ Networking improvements: support for events, quantization, many entities, etc.
+ Audio support: adapt open source audio system to our engine.
+ Scripting support: support manipulating entity-components with Lua script.
+ UI support: integrate support Dear IMGUI into our engine.
+ Save game support: implement a way read/write entities from/to files.
+ Particle system: add support for particle systems in our engine.
+ Physics support: integrate an open source physics system into our engine.
+ Automated testing: implement a system for unit tests and unit test for the engine.
+ Documentation improvements: implement Doxygen (or similar), plus other docs for our engine.

## A Few Notes on Final Projects

Final projects should be completed by Thursday, December 8th. Mechanics for showing
final projects are TBD.
